## Problem Statement
In the realm of e-commerce, a pervasive issue that erodes user trust and hinders informed decision-making is the prevalence of fake reviews. Fake reviews can mislead consumers by providing false information about products or services.

This deceptive practice impacts user trust, as individuals rely on reviews to make purchasing decisions. Identifying and mitigating the influence of fake reviews is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the online marketplace and ensuring that users can make well-informed choices based on genuine feedback.

## Description

To address the issue of fake reviews and uphold the integrity of the online marketplace, a comprehensive solution leveraging Machine Learning Algorithms is proposed. The preprocessed and vectorized dataset, consisting of 20k fake and 20k real reviews, has been utilized to train a classification model using algorithms like SVM. This model has undergone  thorough cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble techniques to ensure robustness and accuracy. 

The vision is to  deploy the refined model on a website as well as android application. This would allow users to verify review authenticity in real-time. Continuous monitoring, updates, and user feedback integration will be implemented across all platforms, providing a holistic solution to empower users in making well-informed decisions based on genuine feedback.
